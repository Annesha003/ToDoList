# TodoList

In this Project ToDo List was created using ReactJS and reactStrap.

The Main Thing in this project is, no backend was used for storing the data, instead we are using local host for storing all the information about the tasks created by user.

Tasks name and description can be created and edited anytime by the user. Once the task is completed user can delete that particular task easily. All this things will be reflected in local host accordingly.
